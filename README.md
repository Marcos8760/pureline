This is literally just pureline which you can find here: https://github.com/chris-marsh/pureline


All i did was made a quick installer so then you dont need to sudo nano your bashrc and i made all the colors
to my tastes. enjoy, future me.

update: the installer doesnt work. just run this:

`echo 'source ~/pureline/pureline ~/.pureline.conf' >> ~/.bashrc`
`mv ".pureline.conf" "~/"`
